## TODO

- Make list of Input yolo, camera cv filters, pir, finger sensors ... into a context - the context construct a prompt -> perception
- Convert all JukeBox or AudioFile.py to InMoov2
- Make LanguageModel
- Make ContextManager
- prompt - gets generated with system info, therby creating "perception" e.g. proximity sensor 2, classification human, position 30
  , if a human is nearby assume its <star/> - can answer the question ... where are you ... ("you are just to the left of me")
- runtime should say what version java is running and warn if not valid
- lower volume or change boot up sound
- current config name doesn't show up in runtime
- initCheckUp.py isn't getting run
- peak is not working or implemented in the UI
- peak isn't default
- multiple sets of process id's on stale ui - fix by stablizing new randome one ?

## DONE

- a delete config button - should do a move to trash directory with a datetimestamp
- dot dot on Runtime... platform info is late, or doesn't get published should be x86 64
