* -----------------
* Purpose: translate serial commands into Propeller language commands,
* mostly relating to IO.  This would allow a computer to easily take
* advantage of Propellers great IO capabilities, while cpu number crunching
* could be done on the computer
*****************************************************************************

This is a Propeller version that clones itself as an Arduino Uno.
The advantage of using a Propeller is that it runs @80Mhz with 8 parallel cores.
Easily implemeted  is i2c , composite video and VGA outputs.

Only Basic Proof of concept actions are implemented so far:-
 (1) Digital Inputs/Outputs   
 (2) Analogs
 (3) Servos PWM

When compared to the Arduino the Propeller version in infact ends up with an extra 2 analogs and extra 14 digital I/Os

NB Coding :- DIRB and OUTB registers are a special case (programmers trick) as they are not implemented by the Propeller (Propeller uses DIRA & OUTA to control its IO and thats all it needs)
             As they are free registers they can be used for bit mapping ... its a real easy way to set and clear bits in a 32 bit word , so i have exploited them as flags in the programming
          :- At momment using some binary ie %0000_0101 notations make it easier to see whats happening ... the underscore is ignored by Propeller
Additional Hardware :-
An ADC chip is needed for the analog conversion....
Sigma/delta circuits could be used, however 2 pins per channel are required...so take easy way and choose the....
