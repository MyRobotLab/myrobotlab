To build the applet, unpack the .jar file (You've presumably done that
if you're reading this message) and do

javac *.java

To pack the applet into a jar file you need to specify a manifest file
containing the line:

Class-Path: ChessBoard.jar

Place the ChessApp.jar and ChessBoard.jar files in the same directory
as your web page.

See the ChessApp webpage
http://english.op.org/~peter/ChessApp/index.html for the kind of
<APPLET> tag you need to include this on a webpage.

This version makes use of the ChessBoard JavaBean for its display. The
source is therefore simply for the engine and applet.
