 * A Peer is a service "used" by another service.  Services which use other services
 * are called composites.  The naming convention for peers is {parentName}.{peerName}
 * E.g. in the case of InMoov head where InMoov service is named i01, the default
 * name of the head peer is i01.head.  InMoov's "peer key" of the head is simply called
 * "head".  The peerKey is hardcoded, but the actual name and type of the peer can change
 * via configuration.  This allows easy to swap services based on configuration. 
 * It also allows sharing of services.  A good example of this is the i01.headTracking.cv
 * and i01.eyeTracking.cv.  In InMoov default config they share an opencv service called
 * i01.opencv (the actual name)
