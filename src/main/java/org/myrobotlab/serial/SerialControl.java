   * FIXME - need a common Serial interface this has been defined many times
   * before
   * 
   * it "should" have open(port, baudrate) and open(port) overload
   * 
   * p4j has a nice interface - similar would be nice too
   * 
   * for some reason we have .connect(port) &amp; .connect(port, baud ...) what
   * is the difference between "connect" and open - "open" is correct in the
   * sense they all are InputStream or OutpuStream .. both are "open" where did
   * connect come from ?
   * 
   * Perhaps its the idea of a Microcontroller service 'connecting' to its
   * actual microcontroller - if thats the case it should be in Microcontroller
   * not in Serial
